BoxGraph is a small library to let you create an interface where your users can create conenctions between ports on boxes.
The typical use-case could be workflow descriptions or creation and modification of connectedness in a graph model.

There are three types of entities;

1) Boxes. These have position, height, width and name. In the future there will be logic to create anything (images or realtime graphics, or whetever) inside a box's interior.
2) Ports. A specific Port always belong to one specific Box
3) Connections. A connection is created between two different Ports.

At the moment BoxGraph only supports Manhattan routing of connections, but will support Beziers in the future.

BoxGraph is focused on user interaction, which generate events. The events are then consumed by the using application. However, BoxGraph could also be used to display a static graph without user interaction.

TODO:

1. Reading and rendering of a JSON graph object.
2. Exporting the currently edited graph in the same data format as (1).
3. Implement events for box creation/deletion, Port creation/deletion.
4. Implement custom box presentation
5. Your idea here :)
